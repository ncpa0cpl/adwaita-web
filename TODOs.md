1. Create a separate file for each component, right now some files include multiple components and this prevents us from auto generating documentations for all of them.
2. Add support for auto-generating documentation for types that use TS Utilities like Omit, Excludes etc.
3. Document all the components and the props, (jsdoc)
4. Prepare a pattern for defining examples and additional component descriptions for the docs.
5. Create examples for all the components.
